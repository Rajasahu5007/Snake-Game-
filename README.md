Snake Game Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Snake game is one of the most popular video games that have been played across various platforms, and it remains an excellent way to understand the basics of game development and interactive programming. This version of the game is developed purely with front-end web technologies, making it easy to run in any modern web browser.

Overview
The goal of the Snake game is simple: control a snake to collect food, causing it to grow longer with each piece. The player needs to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own tail. The game ends when either of these conditions are met. The game’s mechanics are based on the traditional Snake gameplay, where the snake moves across a grid, grows longer each time it eats food, and the player must navigate the snake carefully to avoid accidents.

In this project, the primary goal was to showcase how fundamental game logic can be built using HTML for the structure, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactivity. This is an excellent starting point for web developers who want to learn how to build games in a browser without the need for additional frameworks or libraries.

Key Features
Game Mechanics:

The snake moves around the game grid in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
Every time the snake eats food, it grows in length.
The game ends if the snake collides with either the wall or itself.
Responsive and Clean Design:

The game is designed to be responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly to various screen sizes. Whether you play on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, the game will adapt and remain playable.
The interface is simple, clean, and minimal, focusing on the gameplay itself without unnecessary distractions. It uses basic CSS styling for a smooth user experience.
Smooth Controls:

The game uses the arrow keys (or WASD keys) to control the snake’s movement.
The snake’s speed increases slightly after each piece of food is consumed, making the game more challenging as it progresses.
Players can pause or restart the game by pressing specific keys, providing control and flexibility during play.
Real-Time Gameplay:

The game is designed to be played in real-time, with no lag or delays between actions, providing a smooth experience.
It features collision detection for the walls and the snake’s body, ensuring the game behaves as expected.
Scoring System:

The player’s score is based on the number of food items eaten by the snake. Each time the snake eats food, the score increases by one.
The final score is displayed when the game ends, allowing players to track their progress.
Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the basic structure of the game, including the canvas element where the game’s visuals are rendered.
CSS: Used for styling the game, ensuring a clean layout and an engaging user interface.
JavaScript: This is where all the game logic happens. JavaScript handles user input, snake movement, collision detection, and rendering of the game’s state. The game loop is controlled by JavaScript's setInterval method to update the screen regularly.
Conclusion
This project is a great example for beginners who want to learn more about building interactive applications with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. By working through the game's development, you can gain insight into how game loops work, how to handle user input, and how to create basic animations. The simplicity of the Snake game allows it to be easily modified or extended with new features, such as adding levels, changing game speed, or implementing different types of food with unique effects.
